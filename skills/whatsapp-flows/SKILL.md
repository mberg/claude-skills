# WhatsApp Flows Skill

Build conversational WhatsApp experiences with dynamic forms, conditional logic, and server integration.

## Quick Start

### What are WhatsApp Flows?

WhatsApp Flows are structured conversations that collect user input through a series of screens. Use them to:
- Collect information (forms, surveys)
- Implement conditional logic (eligibility checks, branching)
- Display dynamic data (products, prices, inventory)
- Validate user input server-side
- Complete multi-step processes

### 5 Key Concepts

1. **Screens** - Individual steps in your flow. Each has a unique ID and layout.
2. **Components** - Building blocks (TextInput, Dropdown, Footer, If, etc.)
3. **Form Data** - User input via `${form.field_name}` binding
4. **Server Data** - Dynamic data via `${data.field_name}` binding
5. **Actions** - What happens: navigate, data_exchange, complete, update_data, open_url

### Minimal Example

```json
{
  "version": "7.1",
  "screens": [
    {
      "id": "GREETING",
      "layout": {
        "type": "SingleColumnLayout",
        "children": [
          {
            "type": "TextHeading",
            "text": "Welcome!"
          },
          {
            "type": "TextInput",
            "name": "name",
            "label": "What's your name?",
            "required": true
          },
          {
            "type": "Footer",
            "label": "Continue",
            "on-click-action": {
              "action": "navigate",
              "next_screen": "CONFIRMATION"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "CONFIRMATION",
      "terminal": true,
      "success": true,
      "layout": {
        "type": "SingleColumnLayout",
        "children": [
          {
            "type": "TextHeading",
            "text": "Hello ${screen.GREETING.form.name}!"
          },
          {
            "type": "Footer",
            "label": "Done",
            "on-click-action": {
              "action": "complete",
              "payload": {
                "name": "${screen.GREETING.form.name}"
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Common Tasks

### I need to collect user information

1. Create a screen with TextInput, TextArea, DatePicker components
2. Add Footer with navigate action to next screen
3. On confirmation screen, use global reference `${screen.FIRST_SCREEN.form.field_name}`
4. See [components.md](reference/components.md) input section

### I need conditional branching

1. Use If component for true/false decisions
2. Use Switch component for multiple options
3. Reference form data: `${form.field_name}` or `${screen.X.form.field}`
4. Maximum 3 levels of nesting allowed
5. See [conditional-logic.md](reference/conditional-logic.md)

### I need to validate with a backend

1. Add `data_api_version: "3.0"` and `routing_model` to flow
2. Add `data_exchange` action to Footer/DatePicker/selection component
3. Server receives form data in payload
4. Server validates and responds with next screen or errors
5. See [server-integration.md](reference/server-integration.md)

### I need to display dynamic data

1. Declare data schema on screen with `__example__` values
2. Use data_exchange action to fetch from server
3. Reference with `${data.field_name}` in Dropdown, NavigationList, text
4. See [data-binding.md](reference/data-binding.md)

### I need to validate my Flow JSON

```bash
# Full validation
python scripts/validate_flow.py your-flow.json

# Component-specific validation
python scripts/validate_components.py your-flow.json
```

Validators check:
- JSON syntax
- Required properties
- Component counts
- Character limits
- Field name matching

---

## Best Practices

### Form Design
1. Keep screens focused - one question per screen is ideal
2. Use clear, concise labels
3. Provide helpful validation messages
4. Show progress through multi-step flows
5. Make required fields obvious

### Data Handling
1. Always validate on server (never trust client)
2. Use global references `${screen.X.form.field}` instead of payloads
3. Mark sensitive fields with `sensitive: true`
4. Never expose sensitive data in error messages
5. Use HTTPS for all external URLs

### Conditional Logic
1. Keep conditions simple (one or two checks)
2. Use Switch instead of nested If for many options
3. Test all branches thoroughly
4. Provide feedback for conditional content
5. Document complex logic with comments

### Performance
1. Keep JSON under 1MB when possible
2. Optimize image sizes (max 300KB)
3. Limit components per screen (max 50)
4. Use server pagination for large datasets
5. Cache dynamic data when appropriate

### Mobile Considerations
1. Design for small screens (320px width)
2. Keep text concise and readable
3. Test on actual devices
4. Use larger touch targets (buttons)
5. Minimize scrolling

## Troubleshooting

### "condition is always false"
- Check field name matches component `name` property (case-sensitive)
- Verify field exists before referencing
- Use `${form.field}` not `${form.Field}`

### "Field validation errors don't appear"
- Ensure server returns errors with matching field names
- Check response format includes `errors` object
- Verify field names match input component `name` properties

### "Dynamic data not showing"
- Check data schema includes `__example__` for all properties
- Verify server response includes the data
- Use correct binding syntax: `${data.field_name}`
- Check component supports dynamic data (Dropdown, NavigationList)

### "Navigation not working"
- Verify next_screen exists in screens array
- Check screen IDs are unique (case-sensitive)
- For data_exchange, ensure routing_model includes path
- Verify action is in correct component (Footer, EmbeddedLink, etc.)

### "JSON validation fails"
- Run `python scripts/validate_flow.py` for error details
- Check required properties present (version, screens, layout)
- Verify no undefined component types
- Check screen ID and field name rules (alphanumeric + underscore)

See **[constraints.md](reference/constraints.md)** for complete validation rules and common errors.

## Security Checklist

Before deploying flows with sensitive data:

- [ ] All URLs use HTTPS (no HTTP)
- [ ] Sensitive fields marked with `sensitive: true`
- [ ] All user input validated server-side
- [ ] Errors don't leak information
- [ ] Sensitive data not in logs
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled on endpoints
- [ ] Flow token validation implemented
- [ ] GDPR compliance verified

See **[security.md](reference/security.md)** for detailed security practices.

## Getting Help

- Check **[reference/TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md](reference/TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md)** for navigation by topic or use case
- See **[examples.md](examples.md)** for working flows you can adapt
- Run validation tools: `python scripts/validate_flow.py`
- Review **[constraints.md](reference/constraints.md)** for limits and rules
- Check **[versions.md](reference/versions.md)** if using older Flow versions

1. **Read examples** - See [examples.md](examples.md) for working flows
2. **Choose your components** - See [components.md](reference/components.md)
3. **Plan your actions** - See [actions.md](reference/actions.md)
4. **Design data flow** - See [data-binding.md](reference/data-binding.md)
5. **Validate your flow** - Run `python scripts/validate_flow.py your-flow.json`
6. **Test thoroughly** - All screens, all navigation paths, all conditions
7. **Deploy** - Upload to WhatsApp Business API
